 Hi!<br /><br />If you haven't heard how a delicious Costa Rican tea is hel=
ping thousands of people melt over 6 pounds per week, this email is for you=
!<br /><br />Check here: https://bit.ly/49PbgXb<br /><br />Because I will s=
hare a story from Linda, a 56 years old lady who used this tea to go down f=
rom 210 pounds to under 150 in just 3 months. <br /><br />She is now 149lbs=
 and looks amazing!<br /><br />Read her story below! <br /> <br />"Hi, I=
=E2=80=99m Linda and I=E2=80=99m 56 years old. <br /><br />I am sharing my =
story because I am really proud of the fact that I was able to lose my firs=
t 50 pounds without any workouts or dieting. <br /><br />Anyway, since star=
ting a family 20 years ago I=E2=80=99ve struggled with my weight.<br /><br =
/>I knew having a child would leave me with a few extra pounds=E2=80=A6<br =
/><br />But I didn=E2=80=99t realize how hard it would be to stay in shape =
as a mother... I mean even for a tall woman like me... <br /><br />It only =
dawned on me recently how bad things were when I was told by Doctor that my=
 blood sugar is too high and that I might develop diabetes...<br /><br />Gi=
ven the less-than-active lifestyle I had, it shouldn=E2=80=99t have been a =
big surprise.<br /><br />But the news made me really scared of course.<br /=
><br />And when I thought about all the health problems it could lead to, I=
 became terrified.<br /><br />I started making small changes: reducing my p=
ortion size, trying to cut out the snacks, and even tried a few workouts.<b=
r /><br />But when the current global situation came along, I got so stress=
ed and worried I began to comfort eat.<br /><br />I know this was the worst=
 thing I could have done, but in my head, I kept justifying it. Certain thi=
ngs were beyond my control after all.<br /><br />Plus, what else could I do=
?<br /><br />Gyms were closed, and I never enjoyed working out in the park =
as everyone was always staring at me=E2=80=A6<br /><br />A friend of mine t=
old me about how she was losing 8 pounds a week by drinking a few cups of C=
osta Rican tea every day, but I didn't believe her!<br /><br />But then I c=
ame across a story on Facebook about a woman who was a little older than me=
 and had lost over 100 pounds with the same Costa Rican tea. <br /><br />So=
, I decided to get the recipe and start drinking a few cups of tea every da=
y!<br /><br />Go Here To Get The Costa Rican Tea Recipe & Lose 6Lbs A Week!=
<br /><br />But just to be sure, I managed to get a video call with my Doct=
or. I shared the tea specifications and ingredients with him and he told me=
 it looked perfect for me to try.<br /><br />And that=E2=80=99s exactly wha=
t I did!<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the fact that I became fu=
ll of energy and I was able to control my urges to comfort eat. <br /><br /=
>In fact, after drinking the tea in the morning, I was not hungry anymore. =
<br /><br />In the first few weeks I was able to lose almost 2 inches off m=
y waistline and more than 10 pounds without having to diet or exercise. <br=
 /><br />Having regained control over my eating and having seen that someth=
ing is finally working, gave me a big confidence boost too, which helped me=
 get a promotion at my job.<br /><br />I continued drinking a few cups of t=
ea every day and I decided to start eating healthier.<br /><br />Instead of=
 pizza I went for grilled chicken with some vegetables, and so on... and af=
ter 10 weeks I had lost 50 pounds. <br /><br />I was feeling amazing, plus =
I was slowly getting toned as well.<br /><br />In the next 30 days I lost a=
n additional 10 pounds and my body completely changed as I started to devel=
op an attractive shape. <br /><br />I really think everyone should try the =
Costa Rican tea because it was a huge help for me!"<br /><br />Go Here To G=
