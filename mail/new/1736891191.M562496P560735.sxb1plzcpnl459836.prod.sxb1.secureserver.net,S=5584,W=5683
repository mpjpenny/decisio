Name: Lola Dunbar<br>Email: morrismi1@outlook.com<br>Message: My name is Ah=
met. I'm a bank staff in a Turkish bank. I've been looking for someone who =
has the same nationality as you. A citizen of your country died in the rece=
nt earthquake in Turkey, he had in our bank fixed deposit of $11.5 million.=
 <br /><br />My Bank management is yet to know of his death. If my bank exe=
cutive finds out about his death ,They would use the funds for themselves a=
nd get richer and I would like to prevent that from happening only if I get=
 your cooperation, I knew about it because I was his account manager. Last =
week my bank management held a meeting for the purpose of a bank audit to n=
ote the dormant and abandoned deposit accounts.  I know this will happen an=
d that's why I'm looking for a solution to deal with this situation because=
 if my bank discovers his death, they will divert the funds to the board of=
 directors.  I don't want that to happen. <br /> <br />I request your coope=
ration to introduce you as the kin/heir of the account as you are of the sa=
me nationality as him.  There is no risk;  the transaction is carried out u=
nder a legal agreement that protects you from infringement. I suggest we sp=
lit the funds, 60/40 and 40 for me. I need this fund for my daughter's surg=
ery so keep this info confidential. email me so i can provide you with more=
 information. ahmetturkiye1974@outlook.com<br><br>---<br><br>Date: January =
