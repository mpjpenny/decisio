Name: Eric Jones<br>Email: ericjonesmyemail@gmail.com<br>Message: Hi decisi=
o.co.uk Administrator! I just found your site, quick question=E2=80=A6<br /=
><br />My name=E2=80=99s Eric, I found decisio.co.uk after doing a quick se=
arch =E2=80=93 you showed up near the top of the rankings, so whatever you=
=E2=80=99re doing for SEO, looks like it=E2=80=99s working well.<br /><br /=
>So here=E2=80=99s my question =E2=80=93 what happens AFTER someone lands o=
n your site?  Anything?<br /><br />Research tells us at least 70% of the pe=
ople who find your site, after a quick once-over, they disappear=E2=80=
=A6 forever.<br /><br />That means that all the work and effort you put int=
o getting them to show up, goes down the tubes.<br /><br />Why would you wa=
nt all that good work =E2=80=93 and the great site you=E2=80=99ve built =
=E2=80=93 go to waste?<br /><br />Because the odds are they=E2=80=99ll just=
 skip over calling or even grabbing their phone, leaving you high and dry.<=
br /><br />But here=E2=80=99s a thought=E2=80=A6 what if you could make it =
super-simple for someone to raise their hand, say, =E2=80=9Cokay, let=
=E2=80=99s talk=E2=80=9D without requiring them to even pull their cell pho=
ne from their pocket?<br />  <br />You can =E2=80=93 thanks to revolutionar=
y new software that can literally make that first call happen NOW.<br /><br=
 />Web Visitors Into Leads is a software widget that sits on your site, rea=
dy and waiting to capture any visitor=E2=80=99s Name, Email address and Pho=
ne Number.  It lets you know IMMEDIATELY =E2=80=93 so that you can talk to =
that lead while they=E2=80=99re still there at your site.<br />  <br />You =

nutes versus 30 minutes later is huge =E2=80=93 like 100 times better!<br /=

eature as well=E2=80=A6 once you=E2=80=99ve captured the phone number of th=
e website visitor, you can automatically kick off a text message (SMS) conv=

=E2=80=93 even if they don=E2=80=99t take you up on your offer immediately,=
 you can stay in touch with them using text messages to make new offers, pr=
ovide links to great content, and build your credibility.<br /><br />Just t=
his alone could be a game changer to make your website even more effective.=
